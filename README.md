## Day 1
######   Browser three bros: HTML JS CSS.  Browser three bros: HTML JS CSS.  
######   HTML is like the blueprint of DOM tree in browser. Note the DOM does not have to be 100% built like HTML.  
######   Two phase when loading DOM: 1 Parsing HTML 2 Run Javascript. 
######   Browser read HTML line by line when constructing DOM. It runs the javascript when encounter <script> tag.
######   Javascript has access to 'window', which represents the website that the js runs in. 'Document' is a element of 'window'.  
######   Event queue is a nice feature. The queue is operated in browser not js. I think it's FIFO queue.  
######   Not only JS can register events in the event queue. But also the browser (incoming network traffic) and the user(click) register events.
