# üéâ üç∏ Guys Welcome! This is the note I wrote when I speedrun the book 'Secrets of the Javascript Ninja' üéâ üç∏
## Mark April 16 2020, I started speed running the book.

(TO-DO: Why do I speed run this book?)  
## Day 1 History and introduction of JS.
######   Browser three bros: HTML JS CSS.  Browser three bros: HTML JS CSS.  
######   HTML is like the blueprint of a DOM tree in a browser. Note the DOM does not have to be 100% built like HTML.  
######   Two phases when loading DOM: 1 Parsing HTML 2 Run Javascript. 
######   Browsers read HTML line by line when constructing DOM. It runs the javascript when encounter <script> tag.
######   Javascript has access to 'window', which represents the website that the js runs in. 'Document' is an element of 'window'.  
######   Event queue is a nice feature. The queue is operated in browser not js. I think it's a FIFO queue.  
######   Not only JS can register events in the event queue. But also the browser (incoming network traffic) and the user(click) register events.  
  
## Day 2 Function introduction
######   Function context. There is always one "window" context. "this" keyword inside a function refers to its context.
######   Ways of defining functions. function declaration. arrow function. function as a method. "new" keyword. 
######   "arguments" and "this" are implicitly passed to function as arguments.
######   "arguments" contains all the arguments passed into a function.
######   "arguments" is not an array. 
######   The values in "arguments" entries are shadow-copy of real arguments, so changing one will reflect on others.
######   Use of "new" + function as object initializer. Use "this" to refer to the calling object.
######   Function context depends on function invocation.
######   Arrow functions use the context when it's created, if not explicitly changed.
######   TBH try don't use this, it's chaotic.
  
Took a 3 days break for final exams :>  I thought I could finish this book in a week. But here I am, done 50% after a week with exams and stuff. I need to finish this book in time to work on my other ideas.


## Day 3 Closure and scope. ---- execution context, lexical env and (let, var, const)
######   First of all, there is an execution context. It's like a stack of executing functions ordered by scope. The one at the bottom is always the 'window', the js boss. The more up it goes, the less scope it gets. 
######   Functions, blocks (ex. for loop) can all be put into the execution context.
######   A Lexical environment is a place (like a stack) to store the information of objects inside each closure in order to track them. It's used when determining the scope of any object.
######   Program go search for an object identifier in the lexical env start from the top, if not found, it goes to the closest outer lexical env. And it kept going until it searched the 'window' env and had no results. 
######   Unlike private or public in java. Identifier declared by var is assigned to the closest function lexical env, it skips block (ex. for loop). 
######   Let assign an identifier to the closest lexical env no matter block or function. 
######   Const's scope is the same as Let but, the identifier could not be completely reassigned.
######   JS scans the declared function identifiers excluding arrow functions at the first time it reads the js file. That's why we could use the function that has yet to be declared. 

## Day 4 Generators and promises.    Promise Promise.all Promise.any catch 
######   Generators are a function that could be suspended and resumed. Do *function func_name(){} when you declare it. 
######   Promises are syntax sugar built based on generators. 
######   ES6 introduces async function(){ await another_func_name() }. It's like multiprocessing. Though js is a single thread language.
######   Good syntax sugar Promise Promise.all Promise.any catch. Remember them and you will use them. 

## Day 5 prototyping and fake object oriented programming in javascript. 
######   Prototype is like a parent blueprint.  
######   Prototypes come with any objects(functions). It's auto-attached to the object when it's created. 
######   By initializing obj with a new keyword. By var objBanana = new PenCup(); you initialize objBanana with everything from PenCup's prototype. 
######   By var objBanana = new PenCup(); objBanana.prototype and PenCup.prototype refer to the same prototype in memory. 
######   You can change the prototype by just assigning it like objBanana.prototype = anotherPrototype. But it's stupid to do it.
######   I won't mention some practical pitfalls when using prototypes. Let's use them less, it's safer this way.
######   Coming with ES6, class, inheritance are coming to js. They are all built with prototyping. We just lost another excuse to use a prototype! (I don't like prototyping, it's humanly-designed-complicated). 
######   Use Object.defineProperty(obj,propertyName, {specifications}) to define a property with certain rules like enumarable. writable etc. 


## Day 6 Controlling access to objects --- Getter Setter Proxy
######   You can use Getter and Setter to define the action when retrieve and modifying an 'object liked function'. 
######   Use getter and setter with constructor function to mimic 'private' variables. 
######   Proxy is a way to gain completely control over an object. Get, set and called(as a function) and more could be intercepted by proxy. 
######   Proxy is much slower (dozens of times) than not using it.

## Day 7 Dealing with collections --- Array, Set, Map. 
######   Arrays all has a length property and they all has Array.prototype as their prototype.
######   To add/remove an element from an array, use push, pop and shift, unshft.
######   There are lots of syntax sugars to deal with elements in a array, like .map .every .some .find .filter .sort .reduce. 
######   When initialize map, do new Map(). {} is not a good way to do it because it has properties that weren't explicitly defined.
######   You can simulate an array like object by using Array.prototype.push.call(,) to change the function context of costomized "push". 
######   Cast an array to set by passing the array as an argument when initialize set. Ex. new Set("the array"). 
######   Map is collection so it can be looped by for...of loop. 

## Day 8 Regular expression
######   Too much to go through and I learnt so little from this chapter. So I won't say too much. 
######   Remember to use regular expression when you do string manipulation. It's a really powerful tool. 
######   HTML parser heavily use regular expression.

## Day 8 Modules
######   Before ES6, it was chaos. AMD and commonJS were two popular modularization tool.
######   In ES6, you use export and import. 

## Day 8 Modules
######   Before ES6, js has no built in module tools. AMD and commonJS were two popular module tools. 
######   In ES6, you use export and import. ES6 module was built considering the advantages of both commonJS and AMD. 

## Day 9 Working with DOM
######   The book talked about HTML parser. I'm not interested. 
######   Styling: Move <Style> before <script> because script may look for styles, if it has not been initialized it's gonna be bad. 
######   Styling: When declare styles inside "". It goes like "font-size". But if you try to get an element's style. It will be .style.fontSize. 
######   getComputedStyle(element) is a built in function that returns the final combination style of an element passed. 
######   Style defined in <elementName style='..'> is gonna be considered first before styles inside <style>. 
######   When compute height and width of an element. Sometimes height and width are not accurate. Try use offsetWidth and offsetHeight. 
######   Trashing layouts: We better not mix the read (getEleByID) and write (ele.style=..). We should Batches all reads together and all writes together. To reduce the time-wasting "system-call" read and write times. 

# Surviving events. ## --- My favourite part!
#####   How task queue actually works: 
######   There are MacroTasks(DOM manipulation, events) and MicroTasks(promises). The kenel does one MacroTasks, and then do all available MicroTasks. Then do the next MacroTasks and repeats. 
######   The page get refreshed around every 14ms. Try minimize each task's time lower than this. If not, don't exceed too much cuase its gonna be laggy. 
######   Use setTimeOut() to chunk large operation into smaller onces and execute them as lots of MacroTasks instead of one. 
######   SetInterval() insert the task into MacroTask intime at every scheduled time if the previous SetInterval MacroTask is not in the task queue (has been processed already). 

######   Every time a event happens, we need to find the elements that triggers the event from the DOM tree. It's called event propagation. But How? 
######   (Event propagation) Two ways: event bubbling and event capturing. 
######   Event bubbling start from the targeted element and goes up to find other elements. Event Capturing goes top down. 
######   You can specify which way of propagation you want to use by putting true as the secon argument of addEventListener. Default is bubbling. 
######   So mordern browsers uses both ways of event propagation. 
######   Inside an event handler. 'This' refers to the element on which the event handler is registered. event.target refers to the element where the event is triggered on. 
######   Custom event is a very powerful tool for loose coupling. It's really for writing better codes. Pls use it when you can. 

Lastly, be careful when develop cross-brower websites. I think it's really hard to illustrate every details about this. Just learn while you go.
